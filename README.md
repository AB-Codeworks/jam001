Game

A new browser game I'm developing using JavaScript (Phaser engine).
Getting it ready for a couple of game jams, then we'll see. 
Jam #1 Restriction: Make a game that is played using only 2 buttons / keys.
Jam #2 Optional Restriction (Accepted!): Make a game using only 4 colours maximum. No tints, no shadows, just 4 solid unvarying colours. Black and white count as colours. Dithering allowed.
Jam #2 Required Theme: Secrets. Game must feature secrets in game play or be themed around something about secrets. E.g. secret area, hidden treasure, game about espionage, etc.
